# Intro

These are some small coding challenges from the TikTok recruiting team.

## example01 - Move zeroes to the end
# Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
# Example:
# [1,0,12,3]. ==> [1,12,3,0]
# Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
# Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Note:
# You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
# Minimize the total number of operations.
# N elements in the array. Runtime complexity O(N)



## example02 - String Searching
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:
// s = "leetcode"
// return 0.

// s = "loveleetcode"
// return 2.




## example03 - Minimum meeting rooms
# Given a list of meet start and end time, output minimal number of meeting rooms needed to host all the meetings.
# Example #1:
# meetings = [[4, 6], [2, 3], [5, 6]]
# Return: 2
# Explain: for 2-3 , we only need 1 room, but we need 2 rooms for meeting 4-6 and 5-6.
# Example #2:
# Meetings = [[7,10],[2,4]]
# Return: 1
# N intervals, Runtime complexity => O(N^2)
def isOverlapped(m1,m2):
    return 1
# [[4, 6], [4, 7], [5, 6]]
